## Overview:

Al Rayak has fallen to the CSAT forces and it is up to you to take it back. Embark with your teammates on a persistent campaign that will span several weeks of real time to liberate all the major cities.
* Experience a massive CTI campaign across and all over Al Rayak.
* Cooperate with 0 to 40 other players, with a Commander role, support systems and recruitable AI troops to fill the gaps.
* Buy troops and vehicles using three different types of resources.
* Build the FOB of your dreams with an ingame "what you see is what you get" system.
* Fight aggressive and cunning hostile forces who react and adapt to your actions.
* Learn that every window is a threat thanks to the custom urban combat AI.
* Accomplish meaningful Secondary Objectives that will benefit your progression.
* Never lose your progress with the built-in server-side save system.
